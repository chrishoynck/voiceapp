## Artemisia VoiceNet
Artemisia VoiceNet is a voice-based application designed for farmers in rural Mali. It serves as a platform for exchanging questions and answers, providing sales information, and accessing agricultural information about Artemisia, available in both French and English. This application is developed using VoiceXML and PHP in Visual Studio Code, with cloud-based data storage (Altervista) for recording interactions and system updates. The directory and file structure on Altervista automates the organization of content by language.

**Features:**

- Bilingual Support: Available in French and English, catering to a diverse user base.
- Voice Interaction: Users can ask questions, receive answers, and access agricultural information through voice commands.
- Cloud-Based Storage: System maintainers can access and update recorded data in the cloud through Altervista.
